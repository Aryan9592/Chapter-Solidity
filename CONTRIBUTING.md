### Suggesting New Example of ERC/EIP

This section guides you through submitting an code example of ERC/EIPs for Chapter-Solidity, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Example of ERC/EIP

- Make sure that example is not already being covered in the project. 
- You have gathered enough resources to work on that. 
- If Someone else has already proposed the same example and still working on that then reach him/her out and ask if any help needed. 
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. See from a bigger picture and represents the use case as well. 

#### How Do I Submit the code

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bansaltushar014/Chapter-Solidity/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.

Don't forget to:

- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- It is compulsory to provide a working demo of your code. Make a recording of 10mb and then upload it on the Readme of your folder. If your recording is above 10mb then compress it to 10mb. 
- Write the article of your code, where explain the code with the steps of execution. Write down the use case more in detail. Article should be published and publically available. Dont forget to mention the link into README of your folder.
