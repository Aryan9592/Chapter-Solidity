# Project Title

Simple overview of VerifySignature

## Description

This sample code represents the use of signature and How it is being verified. 
Basically we have two types of accounts in Ethereum,externally owned accounts and smart contract accounts.Every transaction must be initialized by externall owned accounts to be added on to Blockchain.What if we create smartcontract wallet account to initialize transaction and also  custom verification logic like the  account only send amount to specific address.This standard will  help us to do this.I also included an example like the transaction only initialized by the owner of smart contract. In that example we not only validating the signature we also checking whether the transaction initilized by the owner of smart contract.
